# Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

### **History of Computer Vision**
**From a biological point of view**
- 540 millions years ago : First animals developed eyes -> Explosive speciation
- Now : Vision is biggest sensory system of animals. Especially intelligent animals.
<br>

**History of humans making mechanical vision**
- 1600s : pinhole camera
- 1959 : Study visual processing mechanism in mammals by Hubel & Wiesel -> Simple cells respond to oriented edges. Information moves along the visual processing pathway the brain builds up the complexity until recognize the complex visual word.
- 1960s : Computer vision starts. Block word -> Visual world was simplified into simple geometric shapes. Goal is to recognize and reconstruct what these shapes are.
- 1966 : The Summer Vision Project -> Bulk of the visual system. 
- 1970s : David Marrâ€™s book. About the process that computers to recognize the visual world.
- 1970s : Recognize and represent objects. Generalized Cylinder & Pictorial Structure
- 1980s : David Lowe tries to recognize things by constructing lines and edges.
- 1997 : Image segmentation.
- 2001 : Face detection. 1999-2000 machine learning techniques start to gain momentum.
- Late 90s-2000s : Feature based object recognition. SIFT feature.
- 2006 : Made another step forward and start to recognizing holistic scenes. -> Spatial Pyramid Matching 
- 2000s : Gain momentum in human recognition. -> Histogram of Gradients & Deformable Part Model
- 2006-2012 : PASCAL Visual Object Challenge. (Object recognition) 
- 2009 : ImageNet. Biggest dataset produced in the field of AI.
- 2010-2015 : ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Chaalenge. In image classification, error rate was significantly dropped in 2012. -> by using CNN

### Convolutional Nerual Networks (CNN)
- CNN have become an important tool for object recognition.
- Hierarchical
- CNN has breakthrough moment in 2012. Since then, a lot of effort focused in tuning and tweaking these algorithms.
- CNN was actually in 1998 for recognizing digits.
- Faster computation and Large datasets make CNN performed well.
